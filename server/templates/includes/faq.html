      <h4 class="grid_separator--s">How do I know if I’m a Texas Tribune member?</h4>
      <div class="prose grid_separator--l">
        <p>
          Your membership is current if you have made a donation of at least $1 within the past 365 days, including if you
          have an active yearly or monthly donation. Your membership is considered lapsed one year from your last donation.
        </p>

      <h4 class="grid_separator--s">Are donations to The Texas Tribune tax deductible?</h4>
      <div class="prose grid_separator--l">
        <p>
          Yes. The Texas Tribune is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and donations are tax deductible to the extent of the
          law. Our EIN is 26-4527097
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="grid_separator--s">What is a sustaining membership?</h4>
      <div class="prose grid_separator--l">
        <p>
          A sustaining membership means your donation recurs automatically on a monthly or yearly basis via credit card. Members with recurring gifts help the Tribune pursue big stories and projects and plan budgets a few years at a time. Sustaining memberships also help eliminate lapses in your membership.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can update the credit card information associated with your monthly or yearly donation on your Tribune account. <a href="https://texastribune.org/login">Log in</a>, then update your payment information from the “Membership” tab.

      <h4 class="grid_separator--s">How do I cancel a monthly or yearly donation?</h4>
      <div class="prose grid_separator--l">
        <p>
          We understand circumstances change. You may cancel a recurring gift at any time by <a href="https://texastribune.org/signup">signing up</a> or <a href="https://texastribune.org/login">logging into</a> your Texas Tribune account.
