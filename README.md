Donations
=========

Software to collect donations for nonprofits. It integrates with Salesforce, Stripe, Amazon Pay, Slack and Sentry.

- Python running Flask
- supports single and recurring donations
- easily deployed on Heroku

Getting Started
---------------

The recommended method for running this repo locally is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you don't already have Docker set up, you'll want to [install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) to get a Docker environment set up on your computer.

You'll also need to have an `env` file set up with the environment variables for Stripe
and Salesforce so that Docker can find them. By default the `Makefile` will look for
`env-docker` but this can be overridden with the `DOCKER_ENV_FILE` environment variable.

You should also install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install), which we use for managing Git hooks (including JS formatting via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)). Once downloaded, run `pre-commit install` at the root of this repo. You'll also need Node version 12.

Requirements
------------

Python 3.6+
See requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt for specific Python packages and versions.

Running the Project
-------------------

Run `make`. This simple command file does a few things...
* spins up RabbitMQ and Redis containers that we connect to
* starts the flask app via the initializer in server.app
* builds CSS and JS files in watch mode

After all of this runs, you can interact with the app at `localhost:80`

NOTE: If you are a Tribune engineer, you may need to use `local.texastribune.org/donate` in order to sign in to your account or otherwise interact with the account page.

Running tests
-------------

To run the project tests, run
`make test`

Project Structure
-----------------

Though flask is pretty unopinionated about project structure, we've opted to use a "simple package" approach to our structure as mentioned as a possible option in the [flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/packages/#simple-packages). Thus, the flasky pieces of this project live in the `server` folder. This ends up adhering closest to the current structure of our other major project, creating some consistentcy.
