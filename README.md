Software to collect donations for nonprofits. It integrates with Saleforce, Stripe, Amazon Pay, Slack and Sentry.

Donations
=========

- Python running Flask
- supports single and recurring donations
- easily deployed on Heroku

Getting Started
---------------

The recommended method for running this repo locally is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you don't already have Docker set up, you'll want to [install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) to get a Docker environment set up on your computer.

You'll also need to have an `env` file set up with the environment variables for Stripe
and Salesforce so that Docker can find them. By default the `Makefile` will look for
`env-docker` but this can be overridden with the `DOCKER_ENV_FILE` environment variable.

You should also install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install), which we use for managing Git hooks (including JS formatting via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)). Once downloaded, run `pre-commit install` at the root of this repo. You'll also need Node version 8.

Requirements
------------
Python 3.6+
See requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt for specific Python packages and versions.

Running the Project
-------------------

Run `make backing`. This will start RabbitMQ and Redis.
Run `make`. This will drop you into the Flask app.
Run `make restart`. You can interact with the app at `localhost:80`. This command will also build CSS and JS in watch mode and allow you to make test transactions.

```
C_FORCE_ROOT=True celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=INFO &
celery beat --app app.celery &
# gunicorn app:app --log-file=- --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --access-logfile=-
```

Front end
-------------------
The easiest way to develop is by running `make restart`. Other more granular commands:

+ `yarn run js:dev`: Build JS and put Webpack in watch mode
+ `yarn run ds-tasks-watch`: Build CSS and icons in watch mode
+ `yarn run dev`: Run above two commands together
+ `yarn run lint`: Run ESLint

Running tests
-------------

To run the project tests, run
`make test`
